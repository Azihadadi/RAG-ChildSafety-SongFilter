# RAG-ChildSafety-SongFilter

Efficient, scalable content moderation for song lyrics ensuring child safetyâ€”built using a **Retrievalâ€‘Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline instead of heavy LLM inference.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

- **Context**: Moderating song lyrics on social media for child safety.
- **Approach**: Use pre-built QA embeddings, similarity search, and retrieval to classify songs as safe or not.
- **Benefit**: Fast, resource-light, and effective moderation.

##  Workflow Overview

1. **Embed QA pairs** (child-safety questions/answers)  
2. **Embed song lyrics**  
3. **Compute similarity** (dot product / cosine over top-N)  
4. **Decide safety** based on retrieved top pairs

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azihadadi/RAG-ChildSafety-SongFilter.git
cd RAG-ChildSafety-SongFilter
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/RAG-childSafety-songfilter.ipynb
```

## ðŸ§  Future Work

- Incorporating lightweight LLMs for borderline cases.
- Expanding the knowledge base with more diverse QA pairs.
- Adding multilingual support for global content filtering.
